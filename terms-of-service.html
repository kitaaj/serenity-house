            <h3>2.1 Not Professional Medical Advice</h3>
            <p>
                Serenity House is designed to support your mental wellness journey, but it is <strong>NOT</strong>:
            </p>
            <ul>

                <li>An emergency service or crisis intervention platform</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2.2 Seek Professional Help</h3>
            <p>
                If you are experiencing any of the following, please seek professional help immediately:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Thoughts of self-harm or suicide</li>
                <li>Severe depression, anxiety, or other mental health symptoms</li>

                <h4>Emergency Resources</h4>
                <p>
                    The App provides quick access to emergency helplines for your region.
                    In a crisis, use these resources or contact local emergency services.

            <h3>2.3 No Guarantees</h3>
            <p>
                We do not guarantee that using Serenity House will improve your mental health or wellbeing.
                Results vary based on individual circumstances, and the App should be used as one tool
                among many in your wellness journey.
            </p>

            <!-- Section 3 -->
            <h2 id="ai-services">3. AI Services</h2>

            <h3>3.1 AI Chat Limitations</h3>
            <p>
                The AI chat feature is powered by Google Gemini AI and is designed to provide supportive,
                compassionate responses. However, you must understand that:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The AI is <strong>not a licensed therapist, counselor, or mental health professional</strong></li>
                <li>Responses are generated by machine learning algorithms and may not always be accurate or appropriate
                </li>
                <li>The AI cannot diagnose conditions, prescribe treatments, or provide medical advice</li>
                <li>Conversations are not monitored by humans in real-time</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3.2 AI-Generated Content</h3>
            <p>
                AI features in the App (including chat responses and journal feedback) may occasionally:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Produce incorrect or unhelpful information</li>
                <li>Misunderstand the context of your message</li>
                <li>Generate responses that don't fully address your needs</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Always use your own judgment and seek professional advice for important decisions related to your
                health.
            </p>

            <h3>3.3 No Crisis Detection</h3>
            <p>
                While the AI is designed to be supportive, it <strong>cannot reliably detect</strong> if you
                are in crisis or need emergency intervention. If you're in crisis, please use emergency
                resources rather than relying on the AI chat.
            </p>

            <!-- Section 4 -->
            <h2 id="user-accounts">4. User Accounts</h2>

            <h3>4.1 Account Creation</h3>
            <p>

                <li>Maintain the security of your account credentials</li>
                <li>Notify us immediately of any unauthorized access to your account</li>

            <h3>4.2 Account Security</h3>
            <p>

            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Using a strong, unique password</li>
                <li>Enabling device security features (PIN, biometrics)</li>
                <li>Not sharing your login credentials with others</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4.3 Account Data</h3>

                Your account data is stored both locally on your device and in our cloud backend (when online).

            <h3>5.1 Your Content</h3>
            <p>
                "User Content" includes any data you create in the App, such as:
            </p>
            <ul>

                <li>Journal entries</li>

            </ul>

            <h3>5.2 Ownership</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>You retain ownership of all User Content you create.</strong> By using the App, you
                grant us a limited license to store, sync, and process your content solely to provide the App's
                features.
            </p>

            <h3>5.3 Content Responsibility</h3>
            <p>
                You are solely responsible for your User Content. While we prioritize your privacy, you should
                use discretion about what personal information you record in the App.
            </p>

            <!-- Section 6 -->
            <h2 id="acceptable-use">6. Acceptable Use</h2>
            <p>You agree NOT to use the App to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Violate any applicable laws or regulations</li>
                <li>Attempt to gain unauthorized access to our systems or other users' accounts</li>
                <li>Reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the App</li>

            <h3>7.1 Offline Functionality</h3>
            <p>
                Serenity House is designed with an offline-first architecture. Core features (mood tracking,
                journaling, viewing history) work without an internet connection. Your data syncs automatically
                when you're back online.
            </p>

            <h3>7.2 Online Features</h3>
            <p>
                Some features require an internet connection:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>AI chat conversations</li>
                <li>AI journal feedback</li>
                <li>Cloud sync and backup</li>
                <li>Account authentication</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>7.3 No Uptime Guarantee</h3>
            <p>
                While we strive for high availability, we do not guarantee that online services will be
                available 100% of the time. We may experience downtime due to maintenance, updates, or
                unforeseen issues.
            </p>

            </p>

            <h3>8.2 Limited License</h3>

                non-commercial purposes in accordance with these Terms.
            </p>

            <h3>8.3 Open Source</h3>
            <p>
                The App may use open-source libraries and components. You can view the open-source licenses
                in the App's Settings under "Open Source Licenses."
